# Digital Clock

This is a simple **Digital Clock** project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to display the current time in real-time (hours, minutes, and seconds) with a modern and responsive visual layout.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — structure of the clock
- **CSS3** — styling with gradient background and shadow effects
- **JavaScript** — real-time logic for updating the clock

## 💻 How It Works

- JavaScript gets the current system time using `Date()`.
- Every second (`setInterval`), it updates the `<span>` elements with the current hour, minute, and second.
- CSS adds a gradient background and shadowed boxes for a more attractive design.
